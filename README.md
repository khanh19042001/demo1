## About the Project

The NEXT System is a web-based, lifelong personal performance improvement system that enables users to improve their performance, positivity, happiness, and fulfillment in an area of life they choose. It provides individual learners and groups of learners with the training, tools, and guidance they need to become neuro-literate and apply their neuro-literacy capabilities in their daily life throughout their entire life. They've already had separate apps, and now they would like to build a web app that includes all these apps as an ecosystem.
